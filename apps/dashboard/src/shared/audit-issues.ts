    severity: "critical",
    title: "Crawler was blocked",
    explanation:
      "The site returned a bot challenge or access denial (e.g. a Cloudflare challenge, 403, or 429) instead of the page. We report this honestly rather than pretending the page is broken — but it means this page could not be audited, and other crawlers like search engines may face similar friction.",
    howToFix:
      'If you own this site, allowlist the "OpenSEO-Audit" user agent in your WAF/bot-protection settings (on Cloudflare: a WAF custom rule that skips bot protection when the user agent contains "OpenSEO-Audit"; on some free tiers you may need to relax bot protection). Then re-run the audit.',
  },
  "server-error": {
    severity: "critical",
    title: "Server error (5xx)",
    explanation:
      "The page returned a 5xx server error. Search engines that repeatedly see server errors will crawl the site less and may drop the page from the index.",
    howToFix:
      "Check the server logs for this URL and fix the underlying error. If the page is gone, return a 404/410 or redirect it to a relevant page instead of erroring.",
  },
  "broken-internal-link": {
    severity: "critical",
    title: "Broken internal link",
    explanation:
      "This page links to an internal URL that returns an error status (4xx/5xx). Broken links waste crawl budget, leak link equity, and frustrate users — they are among the most common and most damaging technical SEO issues.",
    howToFix:
      "Update the link to point at the correct live URL, or remove it. If the target was moved, prefer linking directly to the new URL rather than relying on a redirect.",
  },
  "missing-title": {
    severity: "critical",
    title: "Missing title tag",
    explanation:
      "The page has no <title>. The title is the strongest on-page relevance signal and the headline shown in search results; without it search engines generate one themselves, usually badly.",
    howToFix:
      "Add a unique, descriptive <title> of roughly 50–60 characters that includes the page's primary topic.",
  },
  "broken-page": {
    severity: "warning",
    title: "Page returns an error (4xx)",
    explanation:
      "This crawled URL returned a client error (e.g. 404). If it is referenced from your sitemap or other pages, crawlers keep wasting requests on it.",
    howToFix:
      "If the page should exist, restore it. If it is intentionally gone, remove it from the sitemap and internal links, and consider a 301 redirect to the closest live page.",
  },
  "duplicate-title": {
    severity: "warning",
    title: "Duplicate title",
    explanation:
      "Multiple pages share the same title tag. Search engines use titles to differentiate pages; duplicates make pages compete with each other and depress click-through rates.",
    howToFix:
      "Write a unique title for each page describing its specific content. For templated pages, include the distinguishing attribute (name, category, location) in the template.",
  },
  "duplicate-meta-description": {
    severity: "warning",
    title: "Duplicate meta description",
    explanation:
      "Multiple pages share the same meta description, so search results show identical snippets and users cannot tell the pages apart.",
    howToFix:
      "Write a unique meta description per page, or remove the duplicated one entirely — search engines will generate a snippet from page content, which beats a wrong duplicate.",
  },
  "duplicate-content": {
    severity: "warning",
    title: "Duplicate page content",
    explanation:
      "Two or more URLs serve byte-identical visible text. Search engines pick one version to index and ignore the rest, and ranking signals get split across the duplicates.",
    howToFix:
      "Consolidate duplicates: pick the canonical URL, add rel=canonical from the others, and 301-redirect duplicate URLs where possible (common causes: trailing-slash variants, URL parameters, http/https or www variants).",
  },
  "missing-meta-description": {
    severity: "warning",
    title: "Missing meta description",
    explanation:
      "The page has no meta description. Search engines will assemble a snippet from page text, which is often less compelling and hurts click-through rate.",
    howToFix:
      "Add a meta description of roughly 70–160 characters that summarizes the page and gives a reason to click.",
  },
  "missing-h1": {
    severity: "warning",
    title: "Missing H1 heading",
    explanation:
      "The page has no H1. The H1 tells users and search engines what the page is about; pages without one tend to have weaker topical clarity.",
    howToFix:
      "Add a single H1 that states the page's main topic, consistent with the title tag.",
  },
  "multiple-h1": {
    severity: "warning",
    title: "Multiple H1 headings",
    explanation:
      "The page has more than one H1, which dilutes the main-topic signal and usually indicates a templating mistake (e.g. a logo and a headline both marked up as H1).",
    howToFix:
      "Keep one H1 for the page's main heading and demote the others to H2/H3 (or unstyled elements for non-headings like logos).",
  },
  "redirect-chain": {
    severity: "warning",
    title: "Redirect chain",
    explanation:
      "Reaching the final page requires two or more consecutive redirects. Each hop adds latency, leaks link equity, and burns crawl budget; long chains may not be followed at all.",
    howToFix:
      "Point the first URL (and any internal links) directly at the final destination so there is at most one redirect.",
  },
  "redirect-loop": {
    severity: "warning",
    title: "Redirect loop",
    explanation:
      "This redirect eventually points back to itself, so the URL never resolves. Browsers and crawlers give up with an error.",
    howToFix:
      "Trace the redirect rules for this URL and break the cycle so the chain terminates at a real 200 page.",
  },
  "canonical-conflict": {
    severity: "warning",
    title: "Conflicting canonical signals",
    explanation:
      "The page declares different canonical URLs in its HTML <link rel=canonical> and its HTTP Link header. When signals conflict, search engines ignore both and choose their own canonical.",
    howToFix:
      "Pick one canonical URL and declare it in exactly one place (HTML head is the most common); remove or align the other declaration.",
  },
  "thin-content": {
    severity: "warning",
    title: "Thin content",
    explanation:
      "The page has very little visible text. Thin pages rarely rank, can drag down sitewide quality assessments, and (if the site renders client-side) may indicate content invisible to plain-HTML crawlers.",
    howToFix:
      "Either expand the page with genuinely useful content, noindex it, or consolidate it into a stronger page. If the content exists but is rendered by JavaScript, ensure it is server-rendered or pre-rendered.",
  },
  "images-missing-alt": {
    severity: "warning",
    title: "Images missing alt text",
    explanation:
      "One or more images on the page lack alt attributes. Alt text is an accessibility requirement and the main way search engines understand images.",
    howToFix:
      'Add descriptive alt text to meaningful images; use an empty alt (alt="") only for purely decorative ones.',
  },
  "orphan-page": {
    severity: "warning",
    title: "Orphan page",
    explanation:
      "No crawled page links to this URL — it was only discoverable via the sitemap. Pages without internal links receive little crawl attention and no internal link equity, and users can't find them by browsing.",
    howToFix:
      "Link to this page from relevant pages (navigation, related content, hub pages), or remove it from the sitemap if it shouldn't be indexed.",
  },
  "no-outgoing-links": {
    severity: "warning",
    title: "Page has no outgoing links",
    explanation:
      "The page contains no links at all — a dead end. Link equity that flows into it stops there, crawlers have nowhere to go next, and users have to reach for the back button.",
    howToFix:
      "Add links to related pages, the parent category, or the homepage. If the page's navigation is rendered by JavaScript, make sure it also exists in the server-rendered HTML.",
  },
  "title-too-long": {
    severity: "info",
    title: "Title too long",
    explanation:
      "The title exceeds ~60 characters, so search results will truncate it and the ending may be cut off mid-phrase.",
    howToFix:
      "Shorten the title to roughly 50–60 characters, front-loading the most important words.",
  },
  "title-too-short": {
    severity: "info",
    title: "Title too short",
    explanation:
      "The title is under ~10 characters, which is usually too generic to describe the page or attract clicks.",
    howToFix:
      "Expand the title into a descriptive phrase (roughly 30–60 characters) that states what the page offers.",
  },
  "meta-description-too-long": {
    severity: "info",
    title: "Meta description too long",
    explanation:
      "The meta description exceeds ~160 characters, so search engines will truncate the snippet.",
    howToFix:
      "Trim the description to roughly 70–160 characters while keeping the core message and call to action.",
  },
  "meta-description-too-short": {
    severity: "info",
    title: "Meta description too short",
    explanation:
      "The meta description is under ~70 characters. Short descriptions waste the snippet space search results give you, and search engines often ignore them in favor of text pulled from the page.",
    howToFix:
      "Expand the description to roughly 70–160 characters that summarize the page and give a reason to click.",
  },
  "heading-order-skip": {
    severity: "info",
    title: "Heading levels skip",
    explanation:
      "The heading hierarchy skips levels (e.g. an H4 directly after an H2). This weakens document structure for accessibility tools and content parsing.",
    howToFix:
      "Adjust heading levels so they descend one step at a time (H1 → H2 → H3) without skipping.",
  },
  "slow-response": {
    severity: "info",
    title: "Slow server response",
    explanation:
      "The HTML response took over 1.5 seconds. Slow time-to-first-byte drags down every downstream performance metric and reduces crawl rate on large sites.",
    howToFix:
      "Investigate server/database time and caching for this route; serving cached or statically generated HTML usually fixes it.",
  },
  "noindex-page": {
    severity: "info",
    title: "Page is noindex",
    explanation:
      "The page asks search engines not to index it (via robots meta tag or X-Robots-Tag header). That's often intentional — this is a heads-up, not an error.",
    howToFix:
      "If this page should rank, remove the noindex directive. If it's intentional (admin, thank-you, filter pages), no action is needed.",
  },
  "canonicalized-page": {
    severity: "info",
    title: "Canonicalized to another URL",
    explanation:
      "The page declares a different URL as its canonical, telling search engines to index that URL instead. Fine when intentional (parameter pages, syndication) — a problem if this page was meant to rank.",
    howToFix:
      "If this page should rank on its own, set its canonical to itself. Otherwise no action is needed.",
  },
  "deep-page": {
    severity: "info",
    title: "Page is deep in the site structure",
    explanation:
      "The page is 5+ clicks from the homepage. Deep pages get crawled less often and receive less link equity.",
    howToFix:
      "Add links from higher-level pages (hubs, category pages, navigation) to flatten the path to this page.",
