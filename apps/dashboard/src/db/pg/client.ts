/**
 * Run `fn` with a request-scoped Postgres client in scope.
 *
 * - D1 mode (default): a no-op — just runs `fn` (no Postgres client created).
 * - Postgres mode: creates a fresh per-request client and makes it the active
 *   `pgDb` for the duration of `fn`.
 *
 * Wrap every entrypoint that touches the DB: the `fetch` handler, the
 * `scheduled` cron, and each WorkflowEntrypoint `run`.
 *
 * Per Hyperdrive's guidance we use a single connection (`max: 1` — Hyperdrive
 * pools the origin connections at the edge, so a client-side pool only adds
 * stale-connection risk) and do NOT call `sql.end()`: the Workers↔Hyperdrive
 * socket is torn down automatically when the invocation ends, and the pooled
 * origin connection stays warm for reuse. Not ending it also means a streamed
 * response can keep querying after the handler returns.
