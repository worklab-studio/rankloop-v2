# Contributing to OpenSEO

Contributions are very welcome.

- Open an issue for bugs, UX friction, or feature requests.
- Open a PR if you want to implement a feature directly.
- Community-driven improvements are prioritized, and high-quality PRs are encouraged.

If you want to contribute but are unsure where to start, open an issue and describe what you want to build. You can also join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/c9uGs3cFXr) to talk through ideas first.

## Local development

See [LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](./LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md) for how to run the app locally.

## Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused: one feature or fix per PR.
- For larger features, open an issue first so we can align on the approach before you invest time.
- Before requesting review, run the same root checks used by CI:

  ```sh
  pnpm ci:check
  pnpm test:ci
  pnpm vite build
  ```

- If you changed the website under `web/`, also run:

  ```sh
  pnpm --dir web install --frozen-lockfile
  pnpm --dir web run types:check
  pnpm --dir web run build
  ```
