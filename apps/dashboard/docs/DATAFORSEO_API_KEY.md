# DataForSEO API Key Setup

OpenSEO uses [DataForSEO](https://dataforseo.com/?aff=255379) to fetch SEO data. It's a pay-as-you-go third-party service unaffiliated with OpenSEO. You need an API key to connect OpenSEO to it.

New DataForSEO accounts include $1 of free credit to test with, and the minimum top-up is $50.

## Get your API key

1. Go to [DataForSEO API Access](https://app.dataforseo.com/api-access?aff=255379) (create an account if you don't have one).
2. Click "Send by email" to get your credentials.
3. Copy the longer credentials labelled "Base64" credentials. This is the base64 encoded value of your DataForSEO email and API password in the format `email:password`.

## Where to set it

Set the value as `DATAFORSEO_API_KEY`:

- **Docker self-hosting:** in `.env` (see [`SELF_HOSTING_DOCKER.md`](./SELF_HOSTING_DOCKER.md)).
- **Cloudflare self-hosting:** in `.env.selfhost` (see [`SELF_HOSTING_CLOUDFLARE.md`](./SELF_HOSTING_CLOUDFLARE.md)). Legacy button/Wrangler deployments: as a Worker secret in the dashboard under `Settings` -> `Variables & Secrets`.
- **Local development:** in `.env.local` (see [`LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`](./LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md)).
